# MarsRover

This Application lets you play the role of NASA, or ESA, or a different space agency I haven't heard of.

Discover new plateaus of uncolonised Mars! Deploy Rovers to check 'em out and get samples and the like.

Manage multiple rovers! They don't bump into each other! I checked with NUnit testing!

In future updates, you will be able to:
1. Follow console instructions to build new rovers and discover new plateaus
2. Deploy your rovers to the Plateaus you've discovered
3. Move your rovers around Mars
4. Collect samples
